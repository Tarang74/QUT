# QUT Notes

## By Tarang Janawalkar

Thank you for visiting this page!

On the left panel, you will find notes for units from the Applied & Computational Mathematics and Computer & Software Engineering majors at QUT.

These notes are designed to condense lecture material while also providing additional insights into topics that may not be covered in the unit.

I hope you find this resource useful.
